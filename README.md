Project Sparky: Personalized Student Engagement Chatbot

Overview

Project Sparky aims to revolutionize hybrid learning environments by offering personalized and context-aware support to students through an AI-powered chatbot. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Sparky delivers knowledgeable responses and enhances engagement.

Features

Contextual Understanding: Utilizes LLMs to interpret and respond to user queries effectively.

Personalization: Employs RAG techniques to tailor interactions based on the user's needs and context.

Hybrid Learning Support: Designed to bridge the gap between online and in-person education.

Methodology

1. Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are employed to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. Sparky integrates these models to ensure high-quality interaction.

2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG enhances the chatbot's performance by combining LLM-generated content with data retrieved from a knowledge base, improving accuracy and personalization.
